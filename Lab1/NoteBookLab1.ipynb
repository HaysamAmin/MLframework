    "1. Problem Definition\n",
    "- Understand the business or research problem.\n",
    "- Define the objective: classification, regression, clustering, etc.\n",
    "- Identify success metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, RMSE).\n",
    "2. Data Collection\n",
    "- Gather data from various sources: databases, APIs, sensors, web scraping, etc.\n",
    "- Ensure data is relevant, sufficient, and representative.\n",
    "3. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "- Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers, duplicates).\n",
    "- Transform data (normalization, encoding categorical variables).\n",
    "- Feature engineering (create new features, select important ones).\n",
    "- Split into training, validation, and test sets.\n",
    "4. Model Selection\n",
    "- Choose the appropriate algorithm(s) based on the problem type and data.\n",
    "- Examples: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks.\n",
    "5. Model Training\n",
    "- Train the model using the training dataset.\n",
    "- Tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.\n",
    "6. Model Evaluation\n",
    "- Evaluate performance on the validation/test set.\n",
    "- Use metrics like:\n",
    "- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.\n",
    "- Regression: MAE, MSE, RMSE, RÂ².\n",
    "7. Model Tuning & Optimization\n",
    "- Improve performance by:\n",
    "- Feature selection\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- Trying different algorithms\n",
    "- Ensemble methods\n",
    "8. Deployment\n",
    "- Integrate the model into a production environment (e.g., web app, API).\n",
    "- Ensure scalability, reliability, and security.\n",
    "9. Monitoring & Maintenance\n",
    "- Monitor model performance over time (data drift, concept drift).\n",
    "- Retrain or update the model as needed."
