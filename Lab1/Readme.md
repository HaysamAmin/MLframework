Lab 1:Univariate Linear Regression on the California Housing Prices Dataset



The goal of this project is to understand how different factors influence housing prices in California, we will build three separate univariate linear regression models. Each model will predict the median house value (`median_house_value`) using one of the following independent variables:

1. Median Income (`median_income`)
2. Population (`population`)
3. Number of Households (`households`)

Approach:  
- For each independent variable, we will:
  - Fit a linear regression model.
  - Visualize the regression line and data.
  - Interpret the results and compare the predictive power of each variable.
