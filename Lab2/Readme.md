 Understanding the Problem

Objective:  
Build a model that can best predict the risk of diabetes progression. This will be used as a screening tool to help physicians with identifying patients at risk. 


Approach:  
The models that we look into are:
1. Univariate polynomial regression models
2. Multivariate Polynomial models
3. Decision Trees
4. kNNs

Model evaluation: the models will be evaluated using R-squared, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. To do that we will run a train-validation-test split.:

Introduction:

Using the Scikit-Learn Diabetes dataset. The dataset contains medical records for 442 patients, including 10 numerical features such as BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, along with a target variable that reflects disease severity.
